A pyramid chart provides a proportional visualization of a total in hierarchies. It is a single series chart without an axis. The data is shown as percentages of a total, where the sum of the parts makes up the whole.

<b> Mode </b>

The [SfPyramidChart](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.SfPyramidChart.html) allows you to render a chart in a linear or surface mode by using the [Mode](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.SfPyramidChart.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_SfPyramidChart_Mode) property. In the Linear mode, the height of the pyramid segment is based on the y-value. In the Surface mode, the area of the pyramid segment is based on the y-value. By default, the Mode property is set to linear.

<b>GapRatio</b>

The [GapRatio](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.SfPyramidChart.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_SfPyramidChart_GapRatio) property is used to change the space between two segments. The default value of the GapRatio property is 0, and its value ranges from 0 to 1.

This sample shows how to visualize a comparison of global wealth distribution in 2021 using a .NET MAUI Pyramid Chart. This comparison will help us understand how wealth is distributed among the population and the existing inequalities.
